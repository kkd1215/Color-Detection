# Color Detection

In this color detection project, we are going to build an application through which we can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

# The Dataset

Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In our dataset, we need to map each colorâ€™s values with their corresponding names. We are using a dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names.

The [colors.csv](https://github.com/kkd1215/Color-Detection/blob/main/colors.csv) file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.
